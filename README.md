# Wine_Quality_Pridction
Objective: The objective of the Wine Quality Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of wines based on their chemical and sensory properties. The model should take a set of input features such as acidity levels, alcohol content, pH, and more, and produce a quality rating score for each wine sample. The quality rating can be a numerical score or a classification (e.g., low, medium, high quality). The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and accurate wine quality assessment tool that can assist winemakers, vineyards, or wine enthusiasts in evaluating and improving wine quality.
